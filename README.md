# 🛒 Product Classification using Language Models



---

## 📋 Overview

Welcome to the **Product Classification using Language Models** project! This initiative demonstrates the power of language models in classifying products into their respective departments based on the **Instacart dataset**. Utilizing the **Falcon-7B** model, we generate predictions directly from product names.

## ✨ Features

- **🔗 Dataset Merging**: Seamlessly combines product and department datasets for effective training.
- **🛠️ Model Training & Fine-tuning**: Employs advanced libraries like **Transformers** and **PEFT** for optimal model training and tuning.
- **🧾 Product Classification Pipeline**: Implements a robust text generation pipeline for accurate product classification.
- **📊 Model Evaluation**: Thoroughly assesses performance using a dedicated test dataset.
