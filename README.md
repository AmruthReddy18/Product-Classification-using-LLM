Product Classification using Language Models
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a language model to classify products into their respective departments based on the Instacart dataset. It leverages the Falcon-7B model to generate text predictions from product names.

Features
Merges product and department datasets for training.
Utilizes advanced machine learning libraries like Transformers and PEFT for model training and fine-tuning.
Implements a text generation pipeline for product classification.
Evaluates model performance against a test dataset.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Transformers
PEFT
Datasets
Dataset
The datasets used in this project were downloaded from Kaggle's Instacart Market Basket Analysis. The main files used include:

orders.csv: Contains order information.
products.csv: Contains product information, including names and IDs.
departments.csv: Contains department information for each product.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.6 or higher
Pip
Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-classification.git
cd product-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Load the datasets in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
Run the provided code to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
Adjust hyperparameters as needed in the training arguments.
Example
python
Copy code
# Example code to run the model
import pandas as pd
from transformers import pipeline

# Load datasets
df_product = pd.read_csv("products.csv")
df_dept = pd.read_csv("departments.csv")

# Your training and evaluation code here...
Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using accuracy metrics against a test dataset.
