**Product Classification using Language Models**

**Overview**

This project demonstrates the use of a language model to classify products into their respective departments based on the Instacart dataset. It leverages the Falcon-7B model to generate text predictions from product names.

**Features**

1.Merges product and department datasets for training.

2.Utilizes advanced machine learning libraries like Transformers and PEFT for model training and fine-tuning.

3.Implements a text generation pipeline for product classification.

4.Evaluates model performance against a test dataset.

**Technologies Used**

1.Python

2.Pandas

3.Transformers

4.PEFT

5.Datasets

**Dataset**

The datasets used in this project were downloaded from Kaggle's Instacart Market Basket Analysis. The main files used include:

**orders.csv:** Contains order information.

**products.csv:** Contains product information, including names and IDs.

**departments.csv:** Contains department information for each product.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

1.Python 3.6 or higher

2.Pip
